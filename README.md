# Scala NLP

Trying out different NLP tricks with Scala.

Project boilerplate is created using the [Play framework 2.6 seed](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/NewApplication). 

Currently project uses old Scala version (2.11) because one of the dependencies we use for [plotting the HTML graphs](https://github.com/vegas-viz/Vegas) 
has pre-built libraries only for that version. It's possible to build that project with newer Scala version
in case we want to upgrade (possibly add as a git submodule?)
